## Keep it speedy 🏃

- Book as little time as needed ([15m is ok](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/15-minute-meeting-burnout#:~:text=15%2Dminute%20meeting%2C%20organizational%20psychologist%20Steven%20Rogelberg%20points%20out%20that%20shorter%2C%20more%20focused%20meetings%20are%20old%20hat)) for an efficient conversation
- Not every meeting needs warmup; feel free to dive right in to the intended conversation

## Be agreeable 🤗

- Calibrate to each others' preferences for meeting times, formats, and preparation
- Document preferences for communicating, perhaps through a [Human User Guide](human-user-guide.md) like [Matthew's](examples/human-user-guide-for-matthew.md)

## Remain flexible 🧭

- Make 1:1 calendar invites editable by all parties
- Demonstrate that 1:1s are more important than other meetings through minimal reschduling
- Always prefer reschduling 1:1s over canceling
